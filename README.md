# RNA-SEQ-Variant-Analysis
Calling variants from IBD RNA-seq data 
Used publically available RNA-sequencing data from ArrayExpress. RNA data was from inflammed intestinal mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients. Link is below

# Running the code
First we will need to align the RNA-seq data to reference genome. Refer to code found in alignreads folder in this repo 

Second we will call genomic variants from the RNA-seq data. Refer to code found in variantcall folder in this repo
